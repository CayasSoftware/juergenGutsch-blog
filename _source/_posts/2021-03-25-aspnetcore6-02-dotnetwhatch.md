This is the second part of the [ASP.NET Core on .NET 6 series]({% post_url aspnetcore6-01.md %}). In this post, I want to have a look into the updates on `dotnet watch`. The [announcement post from February 17th](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-1/) mentioned that `dotnet watch` now does `dotnet watch run` by default.

Actually, this doesn't work in preview 1 because this feature didn't make it to this release by accident: https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/30470

BTW: This feature isn't mentioned anymore. The team changed the post and didn't add it to preview 2 though.

The idea is to just use `dotnet watch` without specifying the `run` command that should be executed after a file is changed. `run` is now the default command:

This is just a small thing but might save some time.

## What's next?

In the next part In going to look into the support for IAsyncDisposable in MVC.
