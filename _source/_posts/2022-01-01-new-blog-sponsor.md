I warmly welcome the [YOO Inc.](https://yoo.digital) as a new sponsor of my blog:

The YOO Inc., is located in Basel, Switzerland and serves national as well as international clients and specializes in creating custom digital solutions for distinct business needs.

Actually, YOO Inc. is the first official Sponsor of my blog and is sponsoring for a few months already but I got that cool banner just a few weeks ago. 

Anyway, Thank YOO! 

I got rid of Google AdSense which anyway didn't made a lot of sense on my blog. The less dependencies the better.
