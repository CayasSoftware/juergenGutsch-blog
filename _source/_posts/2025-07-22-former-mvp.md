It's with a mix of emotions that I'm writing this post. After an incredible ten years as a Microsoft MVP, my recent application for renewal was not accepted. Actually, I expected to not being renewed as an MVP, after two years of just small contributions to the community. While the initial feeling is certainly one of disappointment, it's quickly overshadowed by immense gratitude and an overwhelming sense of pride for the journey I've been on and the phenomenal community I've been part of.

## A Decade of Connection

Being a Microsoft MVP was more than just a title; it was a unique opportunity to connect with a passionate and incredibly smart global community. Looking back at the past decade, I'm genuinely thankful for the experiences and connections.

### Direct Access to Experts

One of the most valuable aspects was the immediate access to a network of like-minded individuals. Suddenly, I wasn't just working on my own; I was part of a global collective dedicated to sharing knowledge and pushing technological boundaries.

The private MVP forums were a constant source of insights. Got a tricky ASP.NET Core problem? Chances are, someone in the MVP community had already tackled it. Need to discuss an architectural pattern? You'd get informed perspectives from around the world. This direct line to collective intelligence was truly invaluable.

### Engaging with Product Teams

Another significant benefit was the direct channel to Microsoft product teams. It felt like I had a voice in the direction of the technologies I relied on daily. We'd get early access to new builds, participate in private previews, and offer feedback that genuinely influenced product development.

I recall numerous discussions, both online and in-person, where we'd dissect new features and highlight areas for improvement. Knowing that our input was considered by the engineers building these tools was incredibly rewarding.

### The MVP Summit Experience

The annual MVP Summit in Redmond was always a highlight. This was where the online connections became real. Meeting MVPs from different countries, sharing thoughts, and attending highly technical, confidential sessions directly with product groups was an unparalleled experience. It was an intense, yet incredibly enriching, week of learning and networking.

### Broader Horizons

The MVP award also provided opportunities to speak at various conferences and user groups. It allowed me to share my passion for ASP.NET and application security with wider audiences, which I truly enjoyed. Through these experiences, I formed lasting connections with fellow MVPs and community leaders globally.

## Moving Forward

While my formal MVP status has concluded, my commitment to the ASP.NET community and my passion for sharing knowledge remain unchanged. I'll continue to blog here, engage with the developer community, and explore new technologies whenever I can.

The principles of the MVP program—technical excellence, community contribution, and a deep interest in technology—are central to how I approach my work. I'm looking forward to what comes next and to continuing to connect with many of you.

Thank you, Microsoft, for the opportunity over the past decade. And thank you, my readers and fellow community members, for being an essential part of this journey.
