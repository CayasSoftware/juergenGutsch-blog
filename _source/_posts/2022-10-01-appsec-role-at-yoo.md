Since almost a year, I'm working on an pretty exciting project. I'm defining and creating a new role inside our company that is responsible for application security. Application Security was never a missing aspect in our development team. All the colleagues are great developers and highly motivated to create secure application. 

The actual problem was a missing standard, that sets up every project in the same secure way and that helps the QA to also test security aspects.

## Defining the new role

Defining and creating this role also means, I will take over this role and being responsible to ensure and maintain the security  standards through the entire company. I will also be responsible to keep awareness about security through the entire company and to train the developers, the DevOps responsible persons as well as the QA. I will not going to be the only person that is responsible for application security in general. My job will be to make all collogues feel responsible for application security. That they all have security in mind, that all features will be analyzed from the security perspective as well.

And this is why the process of secure software development doesn't start at development or DevOps. It actually starts at the sales phase. The sales person need to know what type of customer he is selling our services, what type of data the potential customer will be handling with the new project and what type of possible risks he has. The sales person need to know what level of security he needs to sell.

## Selling security

True, we well sell levels of security. Ensure the application security is effort. The more secure the more effort during development and afterwards, while ensuring and testing the application security. A potential customer in a sensitive or risky environment should know that security will cost something. A bank, a power plant, and other big and risky industry are paying for security person that keeps unauthorized people outside of their restricted areas. Such companies should be aware and willing to pay for implementing higher security mechanisms to keep unauthorized person out of the digital restricted areas as well.

Actually, application security need to be ensured in every project and basic security won't be charged separately.

And maybe, you as a software producing company would like to adopt the same standards and processes. Feel free to come to us and for some help. 

## What are the standards we use?

It is the [OWASP](https://owasp.org) foundation that helps me diving into the new topics. So we are going to implement the OWAS Application Security Verification Standard ([ASVS](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)) and the mobile version MASVS of it. ASVS already is divided into three levels of security. Level 1 is the basic level of security that all projects need to implement. Actually Level 1 is quite basic and despite of just a few topics, this is all stuff we as developers already knew, used and implemented. If we have thought about it and if the project pressure wasn't that high. The levels 2 and 3 are adding more security mechanisms to the projects to handle sensitive and critical data and infrastructure.

Those standards are helping us like blueprint for all our projects  to keep the levels of security and it helps our QA to know what to test from the security point of view..

Actually, since ASVS is adopting and covering many other standards as well, we should be sure with future security audits, no matter what standard will be used.

## Is the YOO a secure software company?

The company always created secure software. Since it was more or less a side aspect in the past, we'll now focus on security by following the standards and the process we are going to implement.

So, yes, we'll be a secure software company. But we'll not be certified somehow. OWASP and ASVS are no badges or certificates we can put proudly and high nosed on our website. But we can proudly mention that we are following a standard that was created by well known and independent security experts.

## I'm still a software engineer :-)

The application security role will be only an additional role to my position as a software engineer. In a midsized company like the YOO it won't be such an effort to create a new position like an application security engineer. And therefore it is just a new additional role for me. Our DevOps responsible role works the same. There's need for a dedicated position yet. Both roles are more or less consultancy roles.
