From September 23 to 25 the .NET Conf 2019, hosted by Microsoft, was running virtually on Twitch. Like last year the third day was full of talks done by the community. As well as last year, I also did a talk this year. This time I talked about the ASP.NET Core Health Checks and it went much better than last year. There where no technical problems this year and because of my own live stream on twitch I'm a little bit more used to speak to an screen and a camera.

This years .NET Conf was full of .NET Core 3.0, which was launched during the first day. Also C# 8 and the latest DevOps, Azure, Xamarin and Visual Studio features were hot topics this year.

If you want to watch the talks on demand, there is a [playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLReL099Y5nRd04p81Q7p5TtyjCrj9tz1t) with all of the recordings, as well as a [list on Channel 9](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/NET-Conf-2019). Since the conference was streamed via Twitch, the videos are [also available there](https://www.twitch.tv/visualstudio/videos).
