## Working with Packt

I'd like to thank the Packt team and its motivation and accuracy to create the best result possible. Actually writing isn't that hard, but getting it completely right, nice, and readable afterward is the hard part. Packt did a great job and I really like the result.

Maybe the next project is in the making. ;-)
