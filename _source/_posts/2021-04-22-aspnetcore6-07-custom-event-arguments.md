This is the seventh part of the [ASP.NET Core on .NET 6 series]({% post_url aspnetcore6-01.md %}). In this post, I want to have a quick into the support for custom event arguments in Blazor.

In Blazor you can create custom events and Microsoft now added the support for custom event arguments for those custom events in Blazor as well. Microsoft added a sample in the [blog post about the preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-2/) that I like to try in a small Blazor project.

In the next part In going to look into the support for `CSS isolation for MVC Views and Razor Pages` in ASP.NET Core.
