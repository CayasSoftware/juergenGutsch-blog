This is the second part of the [ASP.NET Core on .NET 6 series]({% post_url aspnetcore6-01.md %}). In this post I want to have a look onto the updates on `dotnet watch`. The [announcement post  from February 17th](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-net-6-preview-1/) mentioned that `dotnet watch` now does `dotnet watch run` by default

Actually this doesn't work in the current preview.

The idea is to just use `dotnet watch` without specifying the `run` command that should executed after a file changed. `run` should be the default command. But it is not. 

I had a look into the sources of the preview
